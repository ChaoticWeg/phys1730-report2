\section*{Introduction}

\noindent
Momentum, like energy, is always conserved. While energy can leave a system (e.g. kinetic energy converted to
heat or sound), it is still conserved overall. In the scenario that we replicate in this experiment, a moving glider 
transfers momentum to a glider at rest. We can observe the conservation of momentum in a system by calculating 
the total momentum of the system before ($p$) and after ($p'$) a collision. To do so, we use the following formulas:
\[ p = m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} \]
\[ p' = m_{1}v_{1}' + m_{2}v_{2}' \]
where $v_i$ is the velocity of the $i$-th glider after the collision. Because momentum is conserved, we expect to 
find that $p=p'$.
