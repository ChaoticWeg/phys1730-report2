\section*{Procedure}

The air track and compressor were set up by the lab instructors prior to
our experiment. We ensured that the track was level by adjusting the base
support screws until a glider in the middle of the track remained stationary.
We then placed a photogate 30 cm from each end of the track and placed a 
rubber band bumper on each end of the track, to prevent the gliders from
colliding harshly into the ends of the track after colliding with one another.
