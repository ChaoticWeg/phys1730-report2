\section*{Abstract}

\noindent
The purpose of this lab is to study conservation of momentum and the 
differences between elastic and inelastic collisions. This lab focuses on
collisions in a one-dimensional system with two objects. By sliding two
gliders with known masses toward each other on an air track and calculating
the total momentum of the system ($p$) and after ($p'$) the collision, we see
that, because $p = p'$, momentum is conserved.
