\section*{Abstract}

The purpose of this lab is to study conservation of momentum and the differences between elastic and inelastic collisions. This lab focuses on collisions in a linear, two-object system. By sliding two gliders with known masses toward each other on an air track and calculating the total momentum of the system ($p$) and after ($p'$) the collision, we see that $p = p'$, and thus momentum is conserved.

\bigskip

We find that momentum is conserved within a margin of experimental error. The percent difference between $p$ and $p'$ in our experiment varies quite a bit, with an average percent difference of \textbf{17.9\%} for inelastic collisions and \textbf{46.5\%} for elastic collisions.
