\section*{Abstract}

\noindent
The purpose of this lab is to study conservation of momentum and the differences between elastic 
and inelastic collisions. This lab focuses on collisions in a linear, two-object system. By sliding 
two gliders with known masses toward each other on an air track and calculating the total momentum 
of the system ($p$) and after ($p'$) the collision, we see that $p = p'$, and thus momentum is 
conserved.
